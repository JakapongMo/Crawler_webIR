I cared about what happened to these people, I cared about their stories and their lives, and there were moments where I was genuinely saddened or excited by what happened to them. And as the story winds toward its various conclusions, I was completely invested in them, hoping for the best, and fearing the worst. For someone there for the story, who wanted a game to feel fun more than they wanted it to feel comprehensive, I was completely absorbed.', 'Source': 'Variety', 'Url': 'https://variety.com/2018/gaming/reviews/red-dead-redemption-2-review-1202993783/', 'Review_score': '90'}, {'Name': 'Red Dead Redemption 2', 'Platform': 'Xbox One', 'Genre': ['Action Adventure', 'Open-World'], 'Developer': 'Rockstar Games', 'Summary': 'Developed by the creators of Grand Theft Auto V and Red Dead Redemption, Red Dead Redemption 2 is an epic tale of life in America’s unforgiving heartland.

[Rockstar]', 'Metascore': '97', 'Review': 'Red Dead Redemption 2’s missteps are few. The autosaving system is a little bit cruel, leading you to replay failed missions not from a pivotal point, but often from the very beginning of the mission or the section; the game should have taken cues from Ubisoft’s Far Cry and implemented far more friendly checkpoint saves. And while horseback riding in this game is largely fantastic, it’s odd to spend so much time tapping a button just to create your horse’s pace. This is intuitive -- but it feels unnecessary at times, too. The entire Red Dead experience, though, feels fantastic overall.', 'Source': 'New York Daily News', 'Url': 'http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/tv/ny-red-dead-redemption-ii-review-20181029-story.html', 'Review_score': '80'}]
